DnD Finder was created using [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/) and [ReactJs](https://reactjs.org/). It is also integrated with the [Deviant Art API](https://www.deviantart.com/developers/authentication) compliant with the Oauth 2.0 specification. The UI consists of over 100 custom components all written from scratch and powered by vanilla CSS. The UI/UX is inspired by minimalism, glassmorphism, and fantasy art with a focus on responsiveness.
