# DnDFinder
Welcome to the DnD group finder.
To sharpen my full stack development skills, I participated in a week long development challenge to write an application from scratch.
This PoC app was inspired by meetup. It demonstrates full CRUD for authentication, events, groups, applications, and messages.
The UI/UX is inspired by minimalism, glassmorphism, and fantasy art with a focus on responsiveness.
